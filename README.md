# FakeFaceDetection
Using OpenCV, detect a set of real faces vs a set of fake ones

This code is written for the course project of ELEC474 - Machine Vision

The goal for this project was to differentiate a set of 3 fake faces 
from a set of 3 real faces. Fake faces are attempting to fool the computer by 
using a printed out image of a face looking at the camera. 

Through applying computer vision techniques (SIFT Feature Matching, Homography) 
it can be seen that the planar nature of printed faces can be exploited!

If you wish to run this code, you will need:
1. proper libaries (I use the anaconda package manager)
2. A notebook environment to parse the files
3. to change the directories to match that of your machines
